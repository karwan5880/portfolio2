# Development History Timeline - Requirements Document

## Introduction

A beautiful, interactive timeline showcasing the developer's journey through various projects and milestones. The timeline features card-by-card navigation with smooth animations, creating an immersive experience that conveys the progression of time and growth as a developer.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Card-by-Card Navigation System

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to navigate through development milestones one card at a time, so that I can focus on each achievement individually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the first card SHALL be perfectly centered in the viewport
2. WHEN I scroll with mouse wheel THEN the timeline SHALL jump to the next/previous card with smooth animation
3. WHEN I use arrow keys THEN the timeline SHALL navigate left/right between cards
4. WHEN I drag the timeline THEN it SHALL snap to the nearest card on release
5. WHEN I click on any card THEN that card SHALL animate to the center position

### Requirement 2: Visual Timeline Connection

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to see a connecting line between timeline cards, so that I can visualize the progression of time and development journey.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the timeline THEN there SHALL be a horizontal gradient line connecting all cards
2. WHEN cards are spaced apart THEN the connecting line SHALL extend far beyond the viewport
3. WHEN hovering over elements THEN the timeline line SHALL remain visible and prominent
4. WHEN navigating between cards THEN the connecting line SHALL create a sense of journey progression

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Card Design and Spacing

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to see well-designed, properly spaced timeline cards, so that each milestone feels important and readable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing cards THEN each card SHALL be 380px wide with 280px height
2. WHEN cards are displayed THEN there SHALL be 8rem (128px) gap between each card
3. WHEN a card is active/centered THEN it SHALL have enhanced visual highlighting
4. WHEN hovering over cards THEN they SHALL show interactive feedback animations
5. WHEN cards contain technology tags THEN they SHALL be displayed with proper styling

### Requirement 4: Progress and Navigation Indicators

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to see my current position in the timeline, so that I understand where I am in the developer's journey.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the timeline THEN the current year SHALL be prominently displayed
2. WHEN navigating between cards THEN the year indicator SHALL update to show current milestone
3. WHEN available THEN navigation arrows SHALL appear for previous/next navigation
4. WHEN at timeline boundaries THEN appropriate arrows SHALL be hidden
5. WHEN progress changes THEN a progress bar SHALL reflect the current position

### Requirement 5: Smooth Animations and Interactions

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want smooth, responsive animations throughout the timeline, so that the experience feels polished and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating between cards THEN animations SHALL use spring physics for natural movement
2. WHEN cards enter view THEN they SHALL animate in with staggered timing
3. WHEN hovering over elements THEN they SHALL respond with smooth micro-interactions
4. WHEN dragging the timeline THEN it SHALL provide elastic feedback at boundaries
5. WHEN animations complete THEN the timeline SHALL be perfectly centered and stable

### Requirement 6: Responsive Design and Accessibility

**User Story:** As a visitor on any device, I want the timeline to work perfectly, so that I can explore the developer's journey regardless of my device or input method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using different screen sizes THEN the timeline SHALL adapt appropriately
2. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all functionality SHALL be accessible
3. WHEN using touch devices THEN drag interactions SHALL work smoothly
4. WHEN using screen readers THEN proper ARIA labels SHALL be provided
5. WHEN animations are disabled THEN the timeline SHALL remain functional

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Core Technologies

- **Framer Motion**: For smooth animations and spring physics
- **React Three Fiber**: For 3D starfield background
- **CSS Grid/Flexbox**: For responsive layout
- **Custom Hooks**: For scroll management and state handling

### Key Features Implemented

- ✅ Card-by-card snap scrolling with perfect centering
- ✅ Extended horizontal timeline connecting line
- ✅ Multiple navigation methods (wheel, drag, click, keyboard)
- ✅ Smooth spring-based animations throughout
- ✅ Current year indicator with progress tracking
- ✅ Navigation arrows with conditional visibility
- ✅ Enhanced hover states and micro-interactions
- ✅ Responsive design for all screen sizes
- ✅ 3D starfield background for immersion
- ✅ Proper accessibility support

### Performance Optimizations

- Efficient animation handling with Framer Motion
- Optimized scroll calculations
- Proper cleanup of event listeners
- Smooth 60fps animations with spring physics

## Success Metrics

1. **User Engagement**: Smooth navigation between all timeline cards
2. **Visual Appeal**: Beautiful connecting timeline with proper spacing
3. **Performance**: 60fps animations with no jank
4. **Accessibility**: Full keyboard and screen reader support
5. **Responsiveness**: Perfect functionality across all devices

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Timeline Filtering**: Filter by technology or project type
2. **Detailed Modal Views**: Expand cards into detailed project views
3. **Timeline Themes**: Different visual themes for the timeline
4. **Export Functionality**: Export timeline as PDF or image
5. **Social Sharing**: Share specific milestones or the full timeline
