# Implementation Plan

Systematic debugging approach to identify and fix critical issues preventing the portfolio from working. Focus on essential functionality restoration with minimal overhead.

## Implementation Constraints

- **No Testing Required**: Do not run tests, create test files, or execute npm test commands during implementation
- **No Build Commands**: Do not run npm run build, npm run dev, or other build-related commands
- **Focus on Code Implementation**: Only write, modify, and create code files as specified in tasks
- **Manual Verification**: Rely on code review and manual inspection rather than automated testing
