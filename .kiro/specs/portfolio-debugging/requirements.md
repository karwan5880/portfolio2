# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The multiverse portfolio implementation has been completed but is experiencing significant bugs and functionality issues that prevent the web page from working properly. This debugging spec aims to systematically identify, diagnose, and resolve all critical issues to restore full functionality while maintaining the intended multiverse experience with theme switching, section navigation, and animations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user visiting the portfolio website, I want the page to load and display correctly so that I can view the portfolio content without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the portfolio website THEN the page SHALL load without JavaScript errors
2. WHEN the page loads THEN all critical components SHALL render visually
3. IF there are console errors THEN the system SHALL identify and log specific error sources
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the basic layout and styling SHALL be applied correctly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate between different portfolio sections so that I can explore all content areas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to scroll between sections THEN the scroll navigation SHALL work smoothly
2. WHEN a user clicks navigation dots THEN the system SHALL navigate to the correct section
3. WHEN a user uses keyboard navigation THEN arrow keys SHALL move between sections
4. IF section navigation fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback navigation methods

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the theme switching functionality to work so that I can customize the visual experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the theme selector THEN all available themes SHALL be displayed
2. WHEN a user selects a theme THEN the visual appearance SHALL change immediately
3. WHEN a theme is applied THEN all sections SHALL reflect the new theme consistently
4. IF theme switching fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to a default working theme

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want all interactive elements to function properly so that I can fully engage with the portfolio content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user interacts with timeline elements THEN the timeline SHALL respond correctly
2. WHEN a user navigates dev-history cards THEN card interactions SHALL work as expected
3. WHEN a user views project links THEN all links SHALL be functional and accessible
4. WHEN a user interacts with any section THEN animations SHALL play smoothly without errors

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user on mobile devices, I want the portfolio to work correctly on my device so that I can access content regardless of screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the site on mobile THEN the layout SHALL be responsive and functional
2. WHEN a user uses touch gestures THEN swipe navigation SHALL work correctly
3. WHEN a user rotates their device THEN the layout SHALL adapt appropriately
4. IF mobile-specific features fail THEN the system SHALL provide desktop fallbacks

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error reporting so that I can quickly identify and fix remaining issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information to the console
2. WHEN components fail to render THEN error boundaries SHALL catch and report the failures
3. WHEN performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL identify bottlenecks and resource problems
4. WHEN debugging is complete THEN all critical functionality SHALL be verified and documented
