# Drone Text Display System Requirements

## Introduction

This feature will transform the drone show rectangle formation into a programmable text display system. The system will allow displaying custom text messages, numbers, and multi-language content (including Chinese characters) on the 128×32 drone rectangle formation. Each of the 4096 drones will act as a pixel that can be individually controlled for color and brightness to form readable text patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Basic Text Rendering

**User Story:** As a drone show operator, I want to display simple English text messages on the rectangle formation, so that I can communicate messages to the audience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the rectangle formation is complete THEN the system SHALL be able to display text messages
2. WHEN displaying text "THANK YOU" THEN all characters SHALL be clearly readable on the 128×32 grid
3. WHEN text is displayed THEN individual drones SHALL light up to form letter shapes
4. WHEN text is not being displayed THEN drones SHALL fall back to the existing random color system
5. IF text is too large for the grid THEN the system SHALL automatically scale the text to fit

### Requirement 2: Timeline Control System

**User Story:** As a drone show choreographer, I want to schedule different text messages at specific times during the show, so that I can create a timed sequence of messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the show reaches a specified timestamp THEN the system SHALL display the corresponding text message
2. WHEN a text message duration expires THEN the system SHALL transition to the next message or return to default colors
3. WHEN multiple messages are scheduled THEN they SHALL display in chronological order without overlap
4. WHEN transitioning between messages THEN there SHALL be smooth fade transitions
5. IF no message is scheduled for the current time THEN the system SHALL use the existing random color display

### Requirement 3: Multi-Language Support

**User Story:** As a drone show operator in different countries, I want to display text in various languages including Chinese characters, so that I can communicate with local audiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying Chinese text "恭喜發財" THEN all characters SHALL be clearly readable on the grid
2. WHEN displaying numbers "0123456789" THEN all digits SHALL be clearly visible
3. WHEN using different languages THEN the system SHALL automatically handle font rendering
4. WHEN characters are complex (like Chinese) THEN the system SHALL optimize for readability on the limited grid
5. IF a character cannot be rendered clearly THEN the system SHALL provide fallback behavior

### Requirement 4: Color Control System

**User Story:** As a visual designer, I want to control the colors of text messages independently, so that I can create visually appealing and thematically appropriate displays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying text THEN each message SHALL support custom color specification
2. WHEN text color is specified THEN all drones forming the text SHALL use that color
3. WHEN no color is specified THEN the system SHALL use white as the default text color
4. WHEN text is not active THEN background drones SHALL remain dark or use existing color system
5. IF multiple colors per message are needed THEN the system SHALL support per-character color control

### Requirement 5: Performance and Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the text display system to integrate seamlessly with the existing drone show without affecting performance, so that the overall experience remains smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text display is active THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps performance
2. WHEN integrating with existing systems THEN all current drone show features SHALL continue to work
3. WHEN switching between text and random colors THEN transitions SHALL be smooth and glitch-free
4. WHEN processing text patterns THEN the system SHALL not cause frame drops or stuttering
5. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to simpler rendering

### Requirement 6: Pattern Generation System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust system that converts text into drone patterns, so that any text input can be accurately displayed on the drone grid.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text is input THEN the system SHALL generate a 128×32 pattern array
2. WHEN generating patterns THEN the system SHALL use canvas-based text rendering for accuracy
3. WHEN text is rendered THEN the system SHALL optimize for the rectangular grid aspect ratio
4. WHEN patterns are generated THEN they SHALL be efficiently uploaded to GPU textures
5. IF text rendering fails THEN the system SHALL provide error handling and fallback patterns

### Requirement 7: Timeline Configuration

**User Story:** As a show designer, I want to easily configure what text appears when during the show, so that I can create complex message sequences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the timeline THEN the system SHALL support JSON-based message definitions
2. WHEN defining messages THEN each SHALL specify start time, duration, text content, and color
3. WHEN messages overlap in time THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts gracefully
4. WHEN timeline is updated THEN changes SHALL take effect without restarting the show
5. IF timeline configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 8: Visual Quality

**User Story:** As an audience member, I want text messages to be clearly readable and visually appealing, so that I can understand the communicated messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing text from the intended audience distance THEN all characters SHALL be clearly readable
2. WHEN text is displayed THEN letter spacing and sizing SHALL be optimized for the grid resolution
3. WHEN using different fonts THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent readability
4. WHEN displaying on the rectangle formation THEN text SHALL be properly centered and aligned
5. IF text quality is poor THEN the system SHALL provide options for font size and style adjustment
