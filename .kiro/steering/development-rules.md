- NEVER use `npm run build` unless explicitly requested
- Assume the code works if it compiles without syntax errors
- Focus on development speed over build verification

## Code Style

- Prioritize clean, readable code
- Use modern JavaScript/React patterns
- Keep components focused and modular

## Framer Motion Projects

- Always use advanced Framer Motion features
- Create smooth, performant animations
- Test animations work on both desktop and mobile
